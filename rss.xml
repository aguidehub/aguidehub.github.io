&lt;p&gt;Golang has been installed successfully. Now we need to check if it has been set up correctly. We can check that from the command prompt or any other terminal. Here we will use CMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the command below to check the installed GoLang version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s move to the environment variables setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup environment variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to check if GOPATH is set up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check that open &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control Panel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;System and Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if GOPATH is set. Here in the image above &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOPATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is set to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;%USERPROFILE%\go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set it to any folder you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOPATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just click Edit and then either write the path or browse the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have installed go in your Windows successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write and run sample code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check our installation working properly or not we are going to write a simple hello world program in golang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just created a hellw-world folder with an index.go file where I have written Print hello world program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// First Go program&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; main
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fmt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Main function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
    fmt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;!... Hello World ...!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is our output of the above code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run go code we have command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;go run filename.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

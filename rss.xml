&lt;p&gt;A moving dashed line, commonly referred to as the “marching ants,” will automatically show the areas marked by the tool.
Refine the Selection with a Quick Mask
Press the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the keyboard to enter &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick Mask mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This step applies a red overlay over the areas that are not selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, switch to Brush from the Tool panel or simply press B on your keyboard. To edit the mask, paint the areas that you want to select by using the colors Black or White.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the painted areas will then come out as Red and anything in this area will be hidden and will be part of the color change later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom out to make room for the border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock the Background layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Canvas Size dialog box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more canvas around the photo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Solid Color fill layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose white for the color of the photo border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select “Layer 0”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Stroke layer style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Zoom out to make room for the border.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the photo border, we’ll be adding more canvas space around the image. So lets give ourselves more room towork by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;zooming out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. To zoom out from your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;keyboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, press and hold the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ctrl key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on a Windows PC, and press the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;minus key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives us more room to see the border:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;step 2: Unlock the Background layer.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;unlock&lt;/strong&gt; the Background layer so we can add other layers below it. To unlock it, in Photoshop CC, just click the &lt;strong&gt;lock icon&lt;/strong&gt;. In CS6 or earlier, press and hold the Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) key on your keyboard and double-click. This removes the lock icon and renames the layer to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Layer 0”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add more canvas space around the image, go up to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image menu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Menu Bar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and choose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canvas Size&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;step 4: Add more canvas around the photo.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canvas Size dialog box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, make sure that the Relative option is checked. And then, in the Anchor grid, make sure that the center square is selected. This will add the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;new canvas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; space equally around the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, enter the size you need for your photo border into the Width and Height fields. Keep in mind that the value you enter will be divided equally between both sides. And that’s true for both the width and the height. So if you want a quarter-inch border around the image, you’ll actually want to enter 0.5 inches for the Width and Height. For a 1-inch border, you’ll need to enter 2 inches. In other words, whatever size you need, enter twice that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my case, I want a half-inch border, so I’ll set both the Width and Height to twice that amount, or 3 inch:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to add the canvas space, click OK to close the dialog box. And here we see the new canvas around the image. The checkerboard pattern means that the space is currently filled with transparency, but we’ll add color to it next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to undo the canvas size and try again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you chose the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wrong size&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for your border, you can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;undo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it by going up to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit menu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and choosing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undo Canvas Size&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.Then &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;re-open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the Canvas Size dialog box (go to Image &gt; Canvas Size) and try again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color Picker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, choose the color you want for your border. I’ll choose red for now, but I’ll show you how to change the color in a moment, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click OK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; when you’re done to close the Color Picker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;step 7: Change the border color.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want something other than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you can choose a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;different color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for your border by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;double-clicking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the fill layer’s color &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;swatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This re-opens the Color Picker where you can choose something different. And as you try different colors, you’ll see a live preview of the new color around the image. So if I choose black instead of white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding a smaller border inside the main border&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve added the main border, let’s add a second, smaller border inside the main one. And we’ll do that using a layer effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 8: Select “Layer 0”.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Layers panel, select the image on “Layer 0”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the Go compiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup environment variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write and run sample code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Download and install Go compiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.dev&quot;&gt;https://go.dev&lt;/a&gt;, press the download button and it will redirect you to the Download page, where you will see an option of OS ( operating system ) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang has been installed successfully. Now we need to check if it has been set up correctly. We can check that from the command prompt or any other terminal. Here we will use CMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the command below to check the installed GoLang version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup environment variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to check if GOPATH is set up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check that open &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control Panel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;System and Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if GOPATH is set. Here in the image above &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOPATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is set to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;%USERPROFILE%\go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set it to any folder you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOPATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just click Edit and then either write the path or browse the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have installed go in your Windows successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write and run sample code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check our installation working properly or not we are going to write a simple hello world program in golang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just created a hellw-world folder with an index.go file where I have written Print hello world program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// First Go program&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; main
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fmt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Main function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
    fmt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;!... Hello World ...!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is our output of the above code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run go code we have command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;go run filename.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

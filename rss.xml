&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s Tutorial will focus on to check datatype in golang in the easiest way, here we try to check datatype in just two lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the below tutorial if you are struggling in installing GO in windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aguidehub.com/blog/how-to-install-golang-in-windows&quot;&gt;https://aguidehub.com/blog/how-to-install-golang-in-windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start today’s tutorial &lt;strong&gt;How to check the data type of variable in Golang?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we will use the go &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflect&lt;/code&gt; package to check data type and to show in the console we will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fmt.Print()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s dive into code…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; main

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fmt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;reflect&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
	dataType &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; reflect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;TypeOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	fmt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;dataType&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the above code, we are hole 123 in data variable and pass in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflect.TypeOf&lt;/code&gt; and it returns their datatype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it will show output &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;int&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onecompiler.com/go/3xx9cm852&quot; target=&quot;_BLANK&quot;&gt;Try it yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting veriable of datatype it’s common task whitch we will use every day in our coding life, so let see how we can convert string to integer in Golang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the below tutorial if you are struggling in installing GO in windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aguidehub.com/blog/how-to-install-golang-in-windows&quot;&gt;https://aguidehub.com/blog/how-to-install-golang-in-windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;strconv&lt;/code&gt; package to convert string to int and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;reflect&lt;/code&gt; for know the data type of veriable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to adding bullets in photoshop with example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add bullet points in Photoshop by using the Type Tool in combination with this symbol &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which you can copy and paste into a text box, the letter &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; typed in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;font Wingdings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new document, select &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;File&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the bar along the top of the screen before editing the settings in the window that comes up to customize the new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use the Font Wingdings.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wingdings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a special font that gets automatically &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;downloaded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; into Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To begin, let’s choose the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type Tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be done by clicking on the icon depicted below located in the toolbar down the left side of the screen, or by hitting the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; button on your keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the tool has been selected, you can click anywhere within the document to start typing. You should notice that once you have clicked to create a new text box, an options bar appears near the top of the screen. At the left of this is a dropdown menu that lets you choose a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;font&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradient overlay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal type tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Add new page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new page in photoshop. Go to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;File&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; menu, click &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, open the pop-up dialog box and select Height and Weight, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;click OK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To soften the edges of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;vignette border&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we’ll use Photoshop’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaussian Blur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; filter. Go up to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; menu at the top of the screen, choose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, then choose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaussian Blur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Go to Filter -&gt; Blur -&gt; Gaussian Blur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 8: Trim away any extra black space.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;trim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; any extra black space around the image, go to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; menu at the top of the screen and select &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Go to Image -&gt; Trim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opens the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dialog box. Select the Top Left Pixel Color option in the top half of the dialog box if it’s not already selected, and leave the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right options selected in the bottom half of the dialog box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuidehub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you to bleed and crop marks system in photoshop with example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What is a bleed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a bleed in Photoshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canvas size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add bleed marks and crop marks in Photoshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a bleed ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bleed is the area on the outside of a document that is cut off after printing.
Now that you know what a bleed is, let’s take a look at how you can add a bleed area in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Add a bleed in Photoshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, let’s add some guides around the edges of your image.
Go to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rulers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Control-R) and then go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;View&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap To&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Document Bounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure that new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;guides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will snap to the image edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On click the top ruler and drag down a guide to the top edge of your image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to draw shapes on your canvas and use live shape properties to interact with your shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select a shape tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set shape tool options&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photoshop comes with the ability to draw and edit vector shapes easily. You can also convert your vector shape to a raster or pixel-based shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Select a shape tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the toolbar, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and hold the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shape tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; group icon to bring up the various shape tool options — Rectangle, Ellipse, Triangle, Polygon, Line, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custom Shape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Select a tool for the shape you want to draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mode: Set a mode for your Shape tool — Shape, Path, and Pixels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill: Choose a color to fill your shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stroke: Choose the color, width, and type of your shape stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W&amp;#x26;H: Manually set the width and height of your shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path operations: Use path operations to set the way your shapes interact with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path alignment: Use path alignment to align and distribute your shape components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path arrangement: Use path arrangement to set the stacking order of shapes you create.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional shape and path options: Click the gear icon to access additional shape and path options to set attributes such as width and color of the on-screen display of your path, and constrain options while drawing shapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Draw a shape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click and drag on the canvas with your selected &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shape tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to draw a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; creates a new shape layer in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Layers panel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shift key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; while drawing to make your shapes proportional.
With your shape layer selected, use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to move your shape around and reposition on the canvas.
To easily scale, transform, or rotate your shape, choose Edit -&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Transform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or press &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control+T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Draw a custom shape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can draw &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;custom shapes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by using shapes from the Custom Shape &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pop-up panel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or save a shape or path to use as a custom shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custom Shape tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the shape tools in the toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by learning how to add images as layers to the same Photoshop document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a new page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Created a new page.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Photoshop, go up to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;File menu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the Menu Bar, choose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and then made new page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by learning how to insert images in Photoshop on top of backgrounds in a single Photoshop document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open both images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the photoshop with your original background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic Lasso Tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free transform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Open both images.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;open both images in photoshop, go to the File menu, click open, then select your image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Free transform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the Hand tool to position the layer wherever you want, resizing it if necessary using the Free Transform tool &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ctrl +T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Grab the handles on the corners or sides of the images and drag inwards to make it smaller. Hold the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alt+Shift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; key to keep the aspect ratio the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Change your background.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click OK and you’re done. Save your file in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PSD format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to preserve all the layer information. With the foreground, background, and original image all on separate layers, your file remains fully editable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add background color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a selection around the main subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Add background color.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Layers panel, click on the New &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Layer and select &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solid Color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color Picker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; window pops up, select any color you want to add, and then &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;press OK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This will fill your subject with the selected color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Make a selection around the main subject.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Photoshop users not on the Creative Cloud, Head over to the Toolbar or press W on your keyboard.
Use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick Selection tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and drag your cursor all over the subject to make a selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moving dashed line, commonly referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;marching ants,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will automatically show the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;areas marked&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by the tool.
Refine the Selection with a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick Mask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Press the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the keyboard to enter &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick Mask mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This step applies a red overlay over the areas that are not selected.&lt;/p&gt;

To edit the mask, paint the areas that you want to select by using the colors Black or White.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the painted areas will then come out as Red and anything in this area will be hidden and will be part of the color change later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you follow the above steps then it will create a new background color and will show on the new background color available on photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

Click your image where you would like to insert text and write anything. When you’re done, press Escape exiting the text field. Notice that a new layer with your text has appeared in the Layers panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you follow the above steps then it will create a text layer and will show on the text layer available on photoshop’s right side section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom out to make room for the border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock the Background layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Canvas Size dialog box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more canvas around the photo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Solid Color fill layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose white for the color of the photo border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select “Layer 0”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Stroke layer style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-add-an-image-to-a-layer-in-photoshop/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;How to add images in photoshop?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Zoom out to make room for the border.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the photo border, we’ll be adding more canvas space around the image. So lets give ourselves more room towork by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;zooming out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. To zoom out from your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;keyboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, press and hold the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ctrl key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on a Windows PC, and press the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;minus key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives us more room to see the border:&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Unlock the Background layer.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;unlock&lt;/strong&gt; the Background layer so we can add other layers below it. To unlock it, in Photoshop CC, just click the &lt;strong&gt;lock icon&lt;/strong&gt;. In CS6 or earlier, press and hold the Alt (Win) / Option (Mac) key on your keyboard and double-click. This removes the lock icon and renames the layer to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Layer 0”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Add more canvas around the photo.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canvas Size dialog box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, make sure that the Relative option is checked. And then, in the Anchor grid, make sure that the center square is selected. This will add the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;new canvas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; space equally around the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, enter the size you need for your photo border into the Width and Height fields. Keep in mind that the value you enter will be divided equally between both sides. And that’s true for both the width and the height. So if you want a quarter-inch border around the image, you’ll actually want to enter 0.5 inches for the Width and Height. For a 1-inch border, you’ll need to enter 2 inches. In other words, whatever size you need, enter twice that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my case, I want a half-inch border, so I’ll set both the Width and Height to twice that amount, or 3 inch:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to add the canvas space, click OK to close the dialog box. And here we see the new canvas around the image. The checkerboard pattern means that the space is currently filled with transparency, but we’ll add color to it next:&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll choose red for now, but I’ll show you how to change the color in a moment, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click OK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; when you’re done to close the Color Picker.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This re-opens the Color Picker where you can choose something different. And as you try different colors, you’ll see a live preview of the new color around the image. So if I choose black instead of white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding a smaller border inside the main border&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve added the main border, let’s add a second, smaller border inside the main one. And we’ll do that using a layer effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 8: Select “Layer 0”.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Layers panel, select the image on “Layer 0”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your newly installed font is now able to use across all of your applications,
and look at successful font change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you follow the above steps then it will add new fonts and will show on the fonts layer available on photoshop’s right side section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome To aGuideHub! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to install and run golang in windows, here I’m not going to tell you what Go is and why we use it, I think you already know, and that’s why you are searching for installation steps of Go programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the Go compiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup environment variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write and run sample code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Download and install Go compiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.dev&quot;&gt;https://go.dev&lt;/a&gt;, press the download button and it will redirect you to the Download page, where you will see an option of OS ( operating system ) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to check if GOPATH is set up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check that open &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control Panel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;System and Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A window will open as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check if GOPATH is set. Here in the image above &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOPATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is set to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;%USERPROFILE%\go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set it to any folder you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOPATH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; just click Edit and then either write the path or browse the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have installed go in your Windows successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write and run sample code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check our installation working properly or not we are going to write a simple hello world program in golang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just created a hellw-world folder with an index.go file where I have written Print hello world program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// First Go program&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; main
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;fmt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Main function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
    fmt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;!... Hello World ...!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is our output of the above code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run go code we have command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;go run filename.go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
